# the Eulogy of Oasis

At first, the oasis was only a dream, and it came out through some planning.

But now there is no need for him to exist any more, he just want to leave the world quitely.

If there is a chance in the future, I will continue,

but if there is no opportunity,

Goodbye, my old friend.
