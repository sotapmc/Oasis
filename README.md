# the Eulogy of Oasis

> As the famous saying goes, the deceased will not be remembered unless he has a reputation. It is not a mistake to do nothing, but it is the greatest sorrow not to be remembered.

At first, the oasis was only a dream, it came out through some planning.

But now there is no need for him to exist any more, he just want to leave the world quitely.

To be, or not to be, no one can answer the question. Oasis can't, either.

I had to seal it in the grave of years.

Sadly, died on the way to born, the stars sparkling at the midnight, spring blossoms and bright moon.

Hot summer comming then, winter snow drop down on the grave.

A sad man left the town, and he never came back.

Goodbye, my old friend.
